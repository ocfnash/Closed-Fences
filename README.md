# Closed-Fences
The C++, Haskell, and Coq files here are independent implementations of a clipping algorithm to solve the USA Computing Olympiad problem 'Closed Fences' (aka fence4).

I wrote about this in detail back in 2013 [here](https://ocfnash.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/haskell-fence4-great-good)
and again in a different context in 2019 [here](http://olivernash.org/2019/02/03/excursion-fv-coq)
